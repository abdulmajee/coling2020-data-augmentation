Titers B-test
for O
CMV B-problem
and O
Epstein-Barr B-problem
virus I-problem
were O
sent O
and O
a B-test
titer I-test
for O
toxoplasma B-problem
was O
sent O
. O

Stool B-test
was O
sent O
for O
ova B-problem
and O
parasites B-problem
. O

Gastrointestinal O
was O
consulted O
. O

Initially O
, O
the O
patient O
did O
well O
in O
terms O
of O
his O
pre-status O
and O
required O
less O
oxygen B-treatment
. O

However O
, O
on O
02/10/91 O
, O
his B-test
respiratory I-test
rate I-test
increased O
and O
his B-test
oxygen I-test
saturation I-test
decreased O
. O

Actually O
in O
reviewing O
the O
records O
at O
this O
point O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
Pentamidine B-treatment
was O
not O
started O
initially O
so O
on O
the B-treatment
antibiotics I-treatment
of O
Erythromycin B-treatment
and O
Gentamicin B-treatment
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
respiratory O
status O
worsened O
and O
his B-test
LDH I-test
climbed O
so O
he O
began O
Pentamidine B-treatment
on O
02/10/91 O
. O

On O
02/11/91 O
, O
the O
patient O
again O
appeared O
more O
comfortable O
this O
time O
with O
50% B-treatment
facemask I-treatment
but O
then O
required O
more O
oxygen B-treatment
, O
dropped O
his B-test
O2 I-test
saturations I-test
, O
and O
was O
intubated O
on O
02/11/91 O
. O

He O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
on O
12/12/90 O
on O
Gentamicin B-treatment
, O
Vancomycin B-treatment
, O
Pentamidine B-treatment
, O
and O
Prednisone B-treatment
. O

Also O
of O
note O
at O
that O
point O
, O
hepatitis B-test
C I-test
virus I-test
serologies I-test
had O
come O
back O
positive O
. O

However O
, O
at O
this O
point O
, O
his B-problem
liver I-problem
function I-problem
test I-problem
abnormalities I-problem
appeared O
more O
consistent O
with O
a B-problem
cholestatic I-problem
picture I-problem
with O
his B-test
direct I-test
bilirubin I-test
being O
12.1 O
and O
total B-test
being O
14.1 O
. O

The B-test
patient I-test
&apos;s I-test
abdominal I-test
CT I-test
scan I-test
showed O
no O
liver B-problem
disease I-problem
and O
no O
obstruction B-problem
. O

The B-test
patient I-test
&apos;s I-test
liver I-test
function I-test
tests I-test
appeared O
to O
improve O
. O

The B-problem
patient I-problem
&apos;s I-problem
penile I-problem
ulcer I-problem
was O
cultured O
and O
grew O
positive B-problem
herpes I-problem
simplex I-problem
virus I-problem
and O
the O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
Acyclovir B-treatment
. O

On O
02/13/91 O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
a B-test
bronchoalveolar I-test
lavage I-test
performed O
which O
showed O
a B-problem
toluidine I-problem
blue I-problem
with O
many B-problem
pneumocysts I-problem
noted O
. O

No O
other B-test
cultures I-test
grew O
out O
and O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
clinical O
status O
deteriorated O
. O

The O
patient O
required O
100% B-treatment
oxygen I-treatment
to O
maintain O
adequate O
oxygen O
saturations O
on O
the B-treatment
ventilator I-treatment
. O

He O
required O
elevated B-treatment
ventilatory I-treatment
pressures I-treatment
with O
PIPS B-test
often O
above O
60 O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
no O
evidence O
of O
baratroma B-problem
was O
ever O
discerned O
. O

However O
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
respiratory O
status O
continued O
to O
decline O
and O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
maintain O
oxygen B-test
saturations I-test
above O
80% O
even O
using O
reverse B-treatment

and O
other B-treatment
modes I-treatment

Patient O
underwent O
liver B-test
biopsy I-test
on O
02/16/91 O
and O
the O
results O
of O
this O
were O
pending O
when O
the O
patient O
died O
. O

The O
patient O
actually O
developed O
decreasing B-problem

on O
02/15/91 O
. O

These O
were O
supported O
with O
blood B-treatment
products I-treatment
and O
Hematology O
was O
consulted O
. O

They O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
secondary O
to O
Bactrim B-treatment
and O
these O
actually O
were O
getting O
better O
when O
the O
patient O
died O
. O

Bone B-test
marrow I-test
biopsy I-test
was O
not O
attempted O
. O

Discussions O
were O
begun O
with O
the O
family O
regarding O
limits O
of O
supportive B-treatment
care I-treatment
. O

Due O
to O
continued B-problem
worsening I-problem
pulmonary I-problem
status I-problem
and O
an O
overall O
grim O
prognosis O
, O
the O
family O
decided O
, O
in O
consultation O
with O
the O
Medical O
Team O
, O
to O
withdraw O
ventilatory B-treatment
support I-treatment
. O

This O
was O
done O
on O
the O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

1. O
Gastrointestinal O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
an B-problem
elevated I-problem
bilirubin I-problem
on O
admission O
with O
decreased B-problem
output I-problem
of O
biliary B-treatment
drain I-treatment
. O

The B-treatment
drain I-treatment
was O
replaced O
over O

by O
IR O
, O
when O
it O
was O
accidentally O
removed O
. O

Increased O

and O
symptoms B-problem
develop O
of O
SBP B-problem
, O
also O
with O
an B-problem
elevated I-problem
white I-problem
count I-problem
. O

He O
was O
treated O
broadly O
with O
amp B-treatment
, O
levo B-treatment
and O
Flagyl B-treatment
. O

Cultures B-test
were O
negative O
and O
onlyon O
one B-test

The B-test
patient I-test
&apos;s I-test
abdominal I-test

Clinically O
, O
this O
was O
consistent O
with O
SBP B-problem
, O
although O
unfortunately O
, O
fluid O
was O
never O
sent O
for O
cytology B-test
and O
a O
lot O
of O
those B-problem
white I-problem
cells I-problem
are O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
his B-problem
cancer I-problem
. O

He B-treatment
underwent I-treatment
abdominal I-treatment
paracentesis I-treatment
approximately O
two O
times O
a O
week O
for O
therapeutic O
. O

This O
had O
to O
be O
performed O
by O
IR O
because O
the B-problem
pocket I-problem
was O
too O
deep O
to O
access O
from O
the O
bedside O
. O

He O
received O
a O
two O

course O
of O
broad B-treatment
spectrum I-treatment
antibiotics I-treatment
and O
will O
be O
maintained O
on O
Levofloxacin B-treatment

for O
prophylaxis B-treatment
against O
SBP B-problem
. O

2. O
Pulmonary O
. O

From O
a O
pulmonary O
standpoint O
, O
he O
continued O
to O
complain O
of O
shortness B-problem
of I-problem
breath I-problem
. O

His B-problem
apical I-problem
pneumothorax I-problem
from O
the O
outside O
hospital O
had O
resolved O
. O

Chest B-test
xray I-test
was O
consistent O
with O
pleurodesis B-problem
. O

However O
, O
with O
persistent B-problem
abdomen I-problem
distention I-problem
, O
there O
is O
likely O
restrictive B-problem
deficit I-problem
and O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
after O
each O
tap B-test
, O
he O
at O
times O
became O
hypotensive B-problem
and O
with O
some B-treatment
mild I-treatment
fluid I-treatment
resuscitation I-treatment
decompensated O
with O
pulmonary B-problem
edema I-problem
, O
requiring O
both O
albumin B-treatment
and O
Lasix B-treatment
to O
try O
to O
mobilize O
third B-problem
space I-problem
fluids I-problem
. O

On O
the O
day O
of O
discharge O
, O
he O
is O
stating O
approximately O
91 O
to O
92% O
on O
three O
to O
four O
liters O
. O

Chest B-test
xray I-test
is O
still O
consistent O
with O
volume B-problem
overload I-problem
. O

The O
plan O
will O
be O
to O
continue O
to O
try O
to O
alternate O
albumin B-treatment
and O
Lasix B-treatment
to O
mobilize O
his B-problem
fluid I-problem
. O

3. O
Cardiovascular O
. O

He O
had O
episodes O

without O
subsequent B-problem
fall I-problem
in I-problem
blood I-problem
pressure I-problem
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
his O

From O
a O
heme O
standpoint O
, O
he O
presented O
anemic B-problem
and O
with O
an B-problem
elevated I-problem
PT I-problem
INR I-problem
. O

He O
required O
a B-treatment
few I-treatment
transfusions I-treatment
during O
his B-treatment
hospital I-treatment
course I-treatment
. O

He O
also O
required O
FFP B-treatment
initially O
to O
reverse O
his B-problem
coagulopathy I-problem
. O

However O
, O
this O
resolved O
on O
its O
own O
over O
the B-treatment
hospital I-treatment
course I-treatment
. O

His B-test
INR I-test
normalized O
, O
however O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
he O
developed O
bilateral B-problem
deep I-problem
venous I-problem
thromboses I-problem
during O
his B-treatment
hospital I-treatment
course I-treatment
and O
will O
be O
maintained O

He O
had O

this O
decreased O
down O
to O
the O
mid O

with O
fluid B-treatment
, O
currently O
at O
1.7 O
on O
discharge O
. O

From O
his B-test
urinalysis I-test
, O
he O
has O
mostly O
a B-problem
prerenal I-problem
state I-problem
. O

However O
, O
he O
does O
require O
diuresis B-treatment
to O
prevent O
increased B-problem
volume I-problem
overload I-problem
in O
his O
lungs O
from O
his B-problem
hypoalbunemic I-problem
state I-problem

At O
the O
time O
, O
Nutrition O
was O
following O
, O
initially O
with O
a O
low O
fat O
, O
low O
cholesterol O
, O
low O
sugar O
diet O
. O

His O
appetite O
is O
decreasing O
somewhat O
as O
his B-problem
disease I-problem
process I-problem
progresses O
, O
therefore O
, O
we O
have O
liberalized O
his O
diet O
for O
him O
to O
take O
what O
he O
wishes O

He O
was O

with O

for O
a O

He O
will O
be O
maintained O
on O
Levofloxacin B-treatment

However O
, O
given O
his B-problem
rapid I-problem
clinical I-problem
decline I-problem

this O
was O
deferred O
and O
I O
do O
not O
suspect O
that O
he O
will O
be O
a O
candidate O
for O
this O
, O
as O
the O
degree O
of O
his B-problem
decline I-problem
bodes O
a O
poor O
prognosis O
for O
him O

His B-problem

here O
has O
been O
controlled O
, O
initially O
on O
Oxycontin B-treatment

As O
he O
becomes O
progressively B-problem
more I-problem
somnolent I-problem
, O
this O
will O
likely O
need O
to O
be O
switched O

was O
consulted O
about O
the O
management O
of O
this O
patient O
. O

The O
specialist O
concluded O
that O
because O
the B-problem
patient I-problem
&apos;s I-problem
hematuria I-problem
seemed O
to O
be O
stable O
and O
hematocrit B-test
to O

damage I-problem
to I-problem
the I-problem
patient I-problem
&apos;s I-problem

. O

Urology B-test
consultation I-test
thinks O
that O

not O
add O
any O

only O
would O
consider O
a B-treatment

the B-test
patient I-test
&apos;s I-test
hematocrit I-test
rose O
to O
37.7 O
on O
the O

The O
patient O
was O
also O
given O
sodium B-treatment

. O

He O
continued O
to O

ASSESSMENT O
: O

The B-test
assessment I-test
was O
that O

had O
a B-problem
GI I-problem
bleed I-problem
. O

He O
was O
transfused O
and O
then O
evaluated O
by O
GI O
. O

showed O
multiple B-problem
angio I-problem
ectasias I-problem
throughout I-problem
the I-problem
stomach I-problem
. O

He O
received O
multiple B-treatment
treatments I-treatment
for O
this O
over O
the O
succeeding O
weeks O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
he O
was O
transfused O
. O

His B-test
platelet I-test
count I-test
was O
maintained O
with O
platelet B-treatment
transfusion I-treatment
as O
necessary O
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
Octreotide B-treatment
to O
try O
to O
slow O
down O
the B-problem
bleeding I-problem
. O

Despite O
all O
these O
measures O
, O
his B-problem
bleeding I-problem
was O
never O
totally O
controlled O
. O

He O
then O
had O
an B-treatment
angiogram I-treatment

Gel I-treatment
foam I-treatment
to O
try O
to O
control O
his B-problem
GI I-problem
bleed I-problem
. O

this O
was O
unsuccessful O
. O

At O
that O
point O
he O
had O
a B-problem
change I-problem
in I-problem
mental I-problem
status I-problem
and O
